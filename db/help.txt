A quick user guide. This can also be found on github at https://github.com/MGrim934/web-app-y3 along with a lengthy design document.

The database should be created in this folder

##Installation
This was created in Python and uses the flask microframework.
To install this application, you will need a version of python as well as the packages the app uses.
You will also need to run two .py files which define tables and fill them up with some dummy data. 
The easiest way to get up and running is to follow these steps.



1. Go to <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>
  * This is a link to Anaconda. This includes an installation of python as well as
	a large collection of useful packages in one tidy installer.
  * Download the latest version for Python 3. This was not made in Python 2.
  * Follow the installation instructions
  * Note: This is the easiest way to get up and running. Anaconda includes flask, SqlAlchemy and other packages used in this project.

2. Once Python and anaconda is installed you will need to install one more package.
	This app uses a package known as "Marshmallow". Open up your terminal and type:
	> pip install -U marshmallow
	
3. Clone the repository from github
  * Documentation on how to do this can be found on github

4. Open up the command console in the appropriate directory and run the following commands.
	> python tableDef.py
	
	> python fillDB.py
	
	* The first defines data base tables and creates the database.
	* The second fills the database with some dummy data.
	
5. Finally into the console type
	> python myApp.py
	
	* This will host the app locally.
	* Navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:5000/> in your browser of choice.
	
6. You should be able to use the app now.

USER GUIDE
#Using the App
I attempted to design the u.i. to be as clear and concise as possible.
Each button is clearly labelled. However, here are some guidelines on how to use the app.

###Log in/Registration
  To actually use this app you must either log in to an existing account or register.
  Simply go to the registration page and create a username and password or use an existing one.
  I have some dummy accounts in there already. Feel free to use those for the sake of testing functionality.
  E.g. User: "admin" Password:  "password" will log you in as the admin.
  
#I created an account. What now?

###DASHBOARD
This is the primary view of the app. Pretty much everything you want to do will be in the dashboard.
You can only view the dashboard if you are logged in.
It will show you the ten most recent posts made by all users of the system when you log in.

###Options

* Create
  * Enter a title, enter your post content and publish it for others to read.
  
* Show Everyone's Posts
	* This will show you the titles of all posts, the date it was made and the author of each post.
	From here you will be able to click to see the full post content. Should you wish to do so.

* Recent Posts
  * Loads in the ten most recent posts for you to see in full.

* Manage My Posts
  * Allows you to see all of the posts you've made with the option for further management.
Right now, this amounts to being able to delete the post.

* Log out!
  * When you are done!
